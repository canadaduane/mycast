MyCast converts a video file to a formatted HTML page. It creates a directory containing all of
the necessary resources for Flash video playback such as index.html, image files and the
JW Media Player.

In addition to basic Mac OS X tools such as the 'killall' and 'open' commands, MyCast uses the
following applications and tools:

  1. Techspansion's VisualHub - converts QuickTime .mov files to Flash .flv format

  2. The VisualHub automation extension script (provides AppleScript enhancements)

  3. qt_info - provides width and height information about QuickTime .mov files
